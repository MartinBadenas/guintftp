This is release 0.1 of guintftp.

See the file "NEWS" to find out what is new in this Flex release.

Read the file "INSTALL" for general installation directives.  Peek near
the beginning of the file "Makefile.in" for special DEFS values.  On most
systems, you can just run the "configure" script and type "make" to build
flex; then "make check" to test whether it built correctly; and if it did,
then "make install" to install it.
